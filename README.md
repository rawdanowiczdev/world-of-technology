# World of Technology

This project was generated with **Angular CLI** (version 11.0.4).

## Technologies

In this project I'm using:

- Angular
- Angular Universal
- Apollo Angular
- Marked (ngx-markdown)
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Git

## Setup

To install this project locally clone the repository and use **npm**.

`$ npm install`

To work at **localhost:4200** in watch mode. Add `-o` flag to open automatically in your default browser.

`$ npm serve`

To build prerender app. The outcome will be located at **/dist/browser** folder.

`$ npm run prerender`

## Server

App is prerendered with **Angular Universal** which improves **SEO** a lot. For a server I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) service.

_In real prod situation I would use Universal in SSR mode which improves SEO for dynamic CMS content. Prerender is just for demo purposes._
